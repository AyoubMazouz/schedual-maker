# Schedule Maker

This project represents my **end-of-year project for 2023 at ISFOO (OFPPT)**, and I take great pride in its development. It stands out due to its significant utility in solving a real problem we encountered, especially considering that many other projects created during that time were relatively straightforward. Before the creation of this application, we relied on a Python script that I developed to convert existing schedules in Excel format to PDF, as depicted in the last image and video. This project is a Software as a Service (SaaS) that empowers users to create schedules using either the ISFOO template or a public school template. It also offers seamless integration of new templates, allowing for easy additions through the config file.

To streamline the scheduling process, the application offers a smooth user experience and various utilities for efficient schedule management and creation. Notable features include:

Tracking availability: The app incorporates a specialized algorithm to check the availability of professors, classrooms, and other relevant statistics. This ensures the prevention of duplicates, conflicts, or complications when using the app.
User-friendly interface: The application allows for exporting various settings, which is particularly useful for development purposes. Additionally, it provides the ability to import and export data to and from Excel.
Import, export capability, and Excel support: All essential features related to creating schedules have been designed with ease and speed in mind. For instance, once a schedule is completed, users can publish their work and share a link to their personal page, where students can conveniently download the schedule.
In addition to these significant features, there are also smaller elements that enhance the overall user experience. By developing this project, my aim was to address a genuine need within the education sector and provide an efficient solution that enhances the scheduling process while streamlining administrative tasks.
